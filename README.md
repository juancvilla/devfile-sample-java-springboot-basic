# Creating an application with a Spring Boot code sample

**Note:** The Spring Boot code sample uses the **8081** HTTP port.

Before you begin creating an application with this `devfile` code sample, Dockerize app with `Dockerfile` and Finally helm char to test in Openshift

First, test de demo, right click on file: `DemoApplication.java' and select option: `Run Java`

Appears something like: 
```
...TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)
```
